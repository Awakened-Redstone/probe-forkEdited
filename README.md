# Probe plugin mod (1.16.1)
This is a fork of [Yesterday17][creator_github]'s [Probe mod][probe_repo], made to generate a file that is used 
on the Visual Studio plugin [ZenScript][plugin_page]

This fork is a version of the mod to be used on 1.16.1 Forge.

| Requirements                  | Version               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [JustEnoughItems (JEI)][JEI]  |  7.0.1.10 or newer    |
| [CraftTweaker][CraftTweaker]  |  7.0.0.23 or newer    |
| [Forge 1.16.1][Forge 1.16.1]  |  32.0.108 or newer    |

At the moment, the generated `.zsrc` file **can't** be used on the Visual Studio plugin, since the plugin hasn't been updated to 
work with the new information format.

This fork still in development, it can not work as expected, more tests will be made later.
